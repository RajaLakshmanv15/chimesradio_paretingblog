            <br>
            <p>By accessing our Service, you accept our Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions of Use, and you consent to

            <h3>II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
            <br>
            <p>We may collect both “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information” about you. “Non-Personal
                Information” includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous
                usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform
                types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number
                of clicks. “Personal Information” includes information that can be used to personally identify you, such
                as your name, address and email address.</p>
            <p>In addition, we may also track information provided to us by your browser or by our mobile application
                when you view or use the Service, such as the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the
                type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of
                access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We use this information for, among
                other things, the operation of the Service, to maintain the quality of the Service, to provide general
                statistics regarding use of the Service and for other business purposes. We track this information using
                cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user’s
                browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s

                preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. The Company may use
                both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your

                cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable
                cookies, some areas of the Service may not work properly.</p>

            <div class="elementor-block-texteditor">
                <h4>Personal Information:</h4>
                <br>
                <p>In general, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share your Personal Information with third
                    parties
                    without your consent. We may share your Personal Information with vendors and other third-party
                    providers who are performing services for the Company. In general, the vendors and third-party
                    providers
                    used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow
                    them to
                    perform the services they provide for the Company. For example, when you provide us with personal
                    information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a
                    delivery,
                    or return a purchase, you consent to our collecting and using such personal information for that
                    specific purpose, including by transmitting such information to our vendors (and their service
                    providers) performing these services for the Company.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as podcast hosting partners, radio streaming
                    partners, programmatic ad partners, payment processors, have their own privacy policies in respect
                    of
                    the information that we are required to provide to them in order to use their services. For these
                    third-party service providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so that you can
                    understand the manner in which your Personal Information will be handled by such providers.</p>
